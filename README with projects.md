# MY FIRST PROJECT...
This repository contains three beginner python projects that mark the start of my coding journey:
1.Basic calculator
2.random numbers
3.Text Based Game...

# DESCRIPTION:
Each project is simple and very basic but those projects helped me alot to understand the basic concepts and logics and also
helped me practice:
# User input handling
# conditional logic (if/elif/else)
# Git and Github basics

# How to Run
1.Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.Navigate to the folder where the project files are saved.
3.Run the file you want using python:
    a.For the Text-Based Game:
          Type textbasedgame.py and follow the prompts
          shown in the terminal.
    b.For Basic calculator:
          Type basiccalculator.py,then enter two numbers and an operator
          (+,-,*,/).The program will display the result.
    c.For the Random Numbers Program:
          Type randomnumbers.py and the program will generate random numbers each time you run it.

# WHAT I LEARNED...
1.Basics of python syntax
2.Handling user input
3.Arthmetic operation
4.Using Random Numbers
5.version control with git & github

Tbh getting these projects onto github wasn't just about writing code-As a beginner it felt like wrestling with
Git commands ,authentication errors,and files i didn't even want to upload.At one point,I felt like Git was testing
my patience but every "error" messege taught me something new:
        # Learning how to fix mistakes step by step
        # I discovered that persistence is just important as syntax.
        # Finally we can solve anything even that feels difficult(if we really wants to).

# Future Plans...
- Add more beginner projects (I'll also include mechanical simulations,CAD integrations).
- My goal is not only to learn one...I'll comeup with different projects (not only coding).
- Build portfolio that merge coding with mechanical engineering design.


# This repo marks the beginning of my both coding and designing journey.
# I'm excited to keep learning,bulding and sharing more projects.
